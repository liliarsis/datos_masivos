# Unit 2
# Introduction

In this section we will see algorithms for classification for Big Data. We can say that a classifier is an algorithm that, by receiving certain information from an object as input, is capable of indicating the category or class to which it belongs out of a limited number of possible classes. There are multiple classification algorithms, per example, decision tree, naive bayes, suport vector machine and more.

## Exercise 1
Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

Algorithms can be classified into:
1. Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events.
Supervised machine learning algorithms can be classified into
- Classification: Naive Bayes, Suport Vector Machine, K-nearst neighboor
- Regression: Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression.

2. In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms can be classified into:
- Clustering: K-means, Mean Shift, K-medoids
- Dimesionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Feature Selection, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

3. Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning.
