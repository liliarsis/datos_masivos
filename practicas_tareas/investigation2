# What is Variance?

Variance (Ïƒ2) in statistics is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. 
That is, it measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and therefore from every other number in the set. 
Variance is calculated by taking the differences between each number in the data set and the mean, 
then squaring the differences to make them positive, 
and finally dividing the sum of the squares by the number of values in the data set.

# Real life example
In investing, the variance of the returns among assets in a portfolio is analyzed as a means of achieving the best asset allocation. 
The variance equation, in financial terms, is a formula for comparing the performance of the elements 
of a portfolio against each other and against the mean.
